        tuna.

        <li>consist of chuck, ground beef, and brisket. He combines the meats, which he recommends doing the day
            before grilling the burgers. Set them in the fridge so they don't fall apart while on the grill.</li>
        <li>Before placing the patties on the grill, which <b>Sam</b> says should be "piping hot", season the patties
            and
            add a touch of oil. Don't forget to roll the seasoning around the edges of the patties.</li>
        <li>Find the hottest spot on the grill, which <b>Sam</b> says is typically two-thirds of the way up, and place
            the
            burger patties.</li>
        <li>While the burgers are cooking, start preparing the burger buns. Season them with light salt and pepper,
            and toast them on both sides on the grill.</li>
        <li><b>Sam</b> says "a busy grill is a delicious grill", While the buns and burgers are cooking, lightly season
            the
            onions with salt and pepper, add a touch of oil, and place them on the grill.</li>
        <li>Baste the patties with some butter to add some more flavor. Sam brushes each side of the patties two
            minutes before they come off the grill. The burger patties should grill for 3 1/2 to 4 minutes on each
            side.</li>
